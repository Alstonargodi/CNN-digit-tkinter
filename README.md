<h2> CNN-digit-tkinter </h2>
When i attend google IO 2021 last july I found you can use machine learning on a mobile device so from that  i create this repository, to learn classify a handwritten digit using a Convolutional neural network and also learning using TensorFlow lite in mobile after, you can try the apps in <a href="https://github.com/Alstonargodi/CNN-digit-tkinter/releases/tag/v1">Release page</a>,I'm using mnist handwriten dataset as data training and testing, this how step to classficy looks like
<ol>
  <li>Create a model in colaboratorty</li>
  <li>Test the model</li>
  <li>Import model using tensorflow lite</li>
  <li>Create android code</li>
  <li>Import the model to ML package in android studio</li>
  <li>create classficer class and attact  model with interpreter</li>
  <li>create main ui with canvas to draw a digit</li>
  <li>after all done run and build the apps</li>
</ol>
