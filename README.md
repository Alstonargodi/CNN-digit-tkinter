<h2> CNN-digit-tkinter </h2>
When I attend google IO 2021 last july I found you can build a machine learning on a mobile device so from that i create this repository for learn classify a handwritten digit using a Convolutional neural network and also learning using TensorFlow lite in mobile after, you can try the apps in <a href="https://github.com/Alstonargodi/CNN-digit-tkinter/releases/tag/v1">Release page</a>, I'm using mnist handwritten dataset as data training and testing, this how step to classicfy looks like

<ol>
  <li>Create a model in collaboratory
  <li>Test the model
  <li>Import model using TensorFlow lite
  <li>Create android code
  <li>Import the model to ML package in android studio
  <li>create classifier class and attact model with an interpreter
  <li>create the main ui with canvas to draw a digit
  <li>after all is done run and build the apps
</ol>

This small project also will be my starter project for the next project classify Javanese script handwritten
